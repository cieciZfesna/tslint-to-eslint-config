One of the most distinctive features of Cantik Itu Luka is its use of magical realism, a literary technique that blends realistic and fantastical elements. For example, Dewi Ayu rises from her grave after being dead for 21 years, a tiger becomes a human lover, and a soldier survives being shot in the head. These elements create a sense of wonder and mystery, but also reflect the absurdity and brutality of the historical events that shape the lives of the characters.
