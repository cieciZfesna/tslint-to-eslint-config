AutoCAD Map 3D 2014 has many features that can help you work faster and more efficiently with spatial data. Some of these features are:

- Directly access spatial data using Feature Data Objects (FDO) technology. You can work with data from a variety of sources, such as shapefiles, databases, web services, and more. You can also edit the data directly in AutoCAD Map 3D without exporting or importing it[^1^].
- Connect to ArcGIS. You can streamline the flow of data between ArcGIS and AutoCAD Map 3D and keep your features information up to date. You can access ArcGIS feature services and basemaps, edit ArcGIS data in AutoCAD Map 3D, and synchronize changes with ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise[^1^].
- Convert data between DWG and GIS formats. You can perform high-fidelity data conversions using MapImport and MapExport commands. You can import and export data in various formats, such as SHP, SDF, KML, KMZ, GML, and more[^1^].
- Precision drafting and data editing. You can use AutoCAD commands and tools to create and modify maps, geospatial data, and topographical models. You can also use specialized tools for tasks such as coordinate geometry, annotation, topology, buffer zones, thematic mapping, and more[^1^].
- Manage infrastructure systems with Enterprise Industry Models. You can create and maintain industry-specific models for water, wastewater, gas, and electric networks. You can use these models to perform analysis, reporting, validation, and editing of network data[^1^].
- Powerful map creation, analysis, and visualization. You can create maps that display your spatial data in various ways, such as styles, labels, legends, scale bars, north arrows, grids, and more. You can also perform spatial analysis functions such as queries, overlays, buffers, joins, and more. You can also visualize your data in 3D using surface models and point clouds[^1^].

With AutoCAD Map 3D 2014, you can work with CAD and GIS data in an integrated environment that supports planning, design, and management of infrastructure assets.
