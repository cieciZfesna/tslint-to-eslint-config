## What is Dungeon Souls?
 
Dungeon Souls is a new dungeon crawling, roguelike, action adventure game from developer Lamina Studios and publisher Black Shell Media[^4^]. The game draws from various influences, including Risk of Rain and Nuclear Throne. It unabashedly borrows many of the elements but does so in its own way.
 
The game features 10 unique characters to choose from, each with their own skills and playstyles. You can play as a barbarian who smashes enemies with his axe, a thief who dashes and stabs with his daggers, a cleric who heals and buffs allies with his prayers, and more. Each character also has a passive ability that can be upgraded with runes found in the dungeons.
 
The dungeons are randomly generated and filled with traps, secrets, and enemies. Each dungeon has a different theme and layout, such as sewers, cathedrals, or caves. You have to activate all the ritual markers in each level to open the portal to the next one. Along the way, you can find chests that contain gold and items that grant you various bonuses and effects. Some items are passive, such as speed boosts or damage buffs. Others are active, such as bombs or potions that you can use with a hotkey.
 
The enemies are varied and challenging, ranging from skeletons and bats to wizards and dragons. They will attack you on sight and use different abilities to hinder your progress. Some enemies can summon more foes, some can shoot projectiles or cast spells, some can explode or poison you. You have to be careful and use your skills wisely to survive.
 
The game also has a permadeath system that makes every run unique and risky. If you die, you lose all your items and progress and have to start over from the beginning. However, you can also unlock new characters, classes, perks, and items that will be available for future runs. You can also spend your gold at the shop between runs to buy permanent upgrades for your stats or skills.
 
## Why play Dungeon Souls?

You can experiment with different characters, items, skills, and perks to find your favorite combination. You can also discover new secrets and surprises in each dungeon that will reward or punish you for your curiosity. The game has a high difficulty level that will test your skills and reflexes.
