## New Content-Aware Remove Tool
 
One of the most impressive features of Lightroom Classic CC 2019 v8.0 is the new Content-Aware Remove tool that lets you erase anything in seconds. Just select an object or blemish and Lightroom Classic will automatically sample nearby areas of your image to blend it away. This is perfect for removing unwanted elements from your photos, such as power lines, people, or trash cans. You can also use it to fix imperfections on your subject's skin or clothing.
 
To use the Content-Aware Remove tool, follow these steps:

1. Select the Spot Removal tool from the toolbar or press Q on your keyboard.
2. Choose Heal mode from the options bar.
3. Adjust the size and feather of the brush using the slider or the bracket keys ([ and ]).
4. Click and drag over the area you want to remove.
5. Lightroom Classic will automatically choose a source area to replace the removed area. You can adjust the source area by dragging it to a different location if needed.
6. Click Done or press Enter to apply the changes.

You can also use the Content-Aware Remove tool to remove multiple areas at once by holding down Shift and clicking on each area you want to remove. You can also use the Option/Alt key to toggle between Heal and Clone modes. Heal mode blends the source and destination areas, while Clone mode copies the source area exactly.
